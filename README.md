# 📊 Strategic Profit & Growth Dashboard  
### Power BI Executive Analytics Project

---

## 📌 Project Overview

This project transforms raw retail transactional data into a **Strategic Profit & Growth Intelligence Dashboard** using Power BI.

The objective is to move beyond basic reporting and deliver **executive-level insights** that clearly answer:

- What should we grow?
- What should we fix?
- What should we stop?

The dashboard connects operational performance (sales, profit, discounts, orders) to strategic business outcomes.

## 🎯 Business Problem

Retail executives often struggle to make informed strategic decisions because transactional data alone does not clearly reveal performance drivers.

While sales may increase, profitability does not always follow due to:

- Discount strategies  
- Product mix imbalance  
- Regional performance differences  
- Margin inefficiencies  

This dashboard was designed to bridge that gap.
